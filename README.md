# Analyzing AB Testing results for an E-commerce website

## Summary
This is an A/B testing assignment which was completed for Udacity's Data Analyst Nano Degree Program. To increase the conversion rate of the shoppers
changes were made to the companies website, so A/B testing was done to analyze the changes through statistical conclusions, 
if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Objectives
* To increase the conversion rate of the visitors in website.
* Perform A/B tests and make recommendations backed by computed inferences

## Project:

### Data Wrangling:
* Remove duplicates or records with missing or mismatched values.
* Imbalance in the treatment and control group.
* Handle the rows where the landing_page and group columns don't align.

### Analysis:
* Compute probabilities of converting:
    * Regardless of page.
    * Given that an individual received the treatment
    * Given that an individual received the control page
* Perform Hypothesis Testing and calculate p-values
* Performed Logistic Regression
